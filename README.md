# todoist-tracker

This project is intended to make it easy to track various metrics for todoist,
including things like:

* how many tasks are currently OVERDUE (including today)
* how much time is allocated to currently OVERDUE (including today) tasks
* the priority level of currently OVERDUE (including today) tasks

`todoist-tracker` is a hack to make it easy to quickly gauge how "underwater"
you are and how productive you've been. It is intended to be set up as a
cronjob with a crontab entry like:

```
45 21 * * * todoist-tracker overdue n
45 21 * * * todoist-tracker overdue time
45 21 * * * todoist-tracker overdue priority
```

which runs `todoist-tracker` every night at 9:45 p.m. By default, the resulting
metrics are stored in a google spreadsheet for subsequent analysis.  Depending
on the version of `requests` that is installed via python dependencies, you may
also want to use `PYTHONWARNINGS=ignore` somewhere in your crontab to avoid
being sent warnings every time the script is run.

## quick start

1. install `todoist-tracker` from pypi:
   ```sh
   pip install todoist-tracker
   ```

1. get your todoist api token from the todoist `Settings` > `Account` > `API
   token`.

1. place your todoist api token in a `todoist.json` file in the repository root
   that looks like this:
   ```json
   {
       "token": "your-token"
   }
   ```

1. get your google spreadsheet credentials by following [the gspread
   instructions](http://gspread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2.html).

1. place your google spreadsheet credentials in a `google.json` file in the
   repository root and add your `workbook_url` to the JSON:
   ```json
   {
     ...
     "workbook_url": "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/SPREADSHEET_ID/edit#gid=0"
   }
   ```

1. [enable the google calendar api
   access](https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=calendar)
   by adding it to the same Google API project as the google spreadsheet
   access. [follow the
   instructions](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/quickstart/python)
   for scripting access to the google API from python and have those
   credentials saved in `~/.credentials/todoist-tracker.json`.

1. :boom: For usage instructions, see
   ```sh
   todoist-tracker -h
   ```

## development

1. instantiate virtual environment
   ```sh
   mkvirtualenv todoist-tracker
   pip install -r requirements/python-dev
   ```

1. add the `bin/` directory to your virtualenv `PATH` and the
   project root to your `PYTHONPATH` with
   ```sh
   # setup paths on virtualenv activation
   echo 'export __PATH_TODOIST_TRACKER=$PATH' > ~/.virtualenvs/todoist-tracker/bin/postactivate
   echo 'export PATH=$PATH:'`pwd`'/bin' >> ~/.virtualenvs/todoist-tracker/bin/postactivate
   echo 'export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:'`pwd` >> ~/.virtualenvs/todoist-tracker/bin/postactivate

   # setup paths on virtualenv deactivation
   echo 'unset PYTHONPATH' > ~/.virtualenvs/todoist-tracker/bin/predeactivate
   echo 'export PATH=$__PATH_TODOIST_TRACKER' >> ~/.virtualenvs/todoist-tracker/bin/predeactivate
   ```

1. follow the quick start instructions above to get your todoist credentials.
